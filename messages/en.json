      "p1": "This chart shows the inflation-adjusted <strong>disposable household income</strong> over time.",
      "p2": "An <strong>upward trend</strong> indicates that household purchasing power is increasing, which generally improves affordability. All figures are adjusted to 2015 currency values to provide a fair comparison across years.",
      "p3": "The income measured is &apos;equivalised,&apos; meaning it&apos;s adjusted for household size to better compare living standards."

    "ptiExplanation": {
      "p1": "This ratio shows how many years of <strong>gross household income</strong> it would take to buy an average home.",
      "p2": "A <strong>higher</strong> ratio means housing is <strong>less affordable</strong>. All data is inflation-adjusted to 2015 dollars for a fair comparison over time."

    "mortgageBurdenExplanation": {
      "p1": "This shows the percentage of <strong>gross household income</strong> needed to cover the monthly payment on an average home.",

      "p1": "This index measures the cost of buying a home relative to renting one. It's calculated by dividing the house price index by the rent price index.",
      "p2": "A <strong>higher</strong> index suggests that house prices are high relative to rental costs. This can indicate that it might be more financially advantageous to rent than to buy.",
      "p3": "The index is set to <strong>100 in 2015</strong>. Values above 100 mean buying has become more expensive than renting compared to 2015."

      "p1": "This chart shows the total number of households in the country over time.",
      "p2": "An <strong>increase</strong> in the number of households can be a significant driver of housing demand, often leading to upward pressure on prices and rents if supply does not keep pace.",
      "p3": "Factors like population growth, immigration, and changes in living arrangements (e.g., smaller household sizes) all contribute to this trend."
